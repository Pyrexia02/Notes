	//comments
	import <libs>;
	public class <Class_Name> {
	    public/private static void main(String[] args) {
 	       <attributes>;
 	       <data>;
  	       <methods>;
  	  }
	}

    Class Name should always start with an uppercase letter. (encouraged, if you don't want also can)
    (since 'non-primitive' lol, like String)
    The name of the java file must match the Class Name.

Some explained meanings:
1. 'new' : It creates a new Java obj & allocates memory for it on the heap. //~!new
           Also used for array creation (array are also objects).
2. 'super' : A reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects. //~!super
             Can be used to call parent class' variables and methods.
3. 'super()' : A reference variable that is ONLY used to refer parent class constructors. //~!super()

============================================================================================================================================ ~!MODIFIERS
There are two groups of modifiers:
    - Access Modifiers: controls the access level
    - Non-Access Modifiers: do not control access level, but provides other functionality


====== ACCESS MODIFIERS ======
// ~!public ~!default ~!private ~!protected

For classes:

    public  : The class is accessible by any other class.
    default : The class is only accessible by classes in the same package. This is used when you don't specify
              a modifier. ref: tag_packages
       + private (Nested Classes +) : ONLY accessible within itself, or top-level class (OuterClass) of nested classes.
       + protected (Nested Classes +) : Code of inner class is accessible in the same package & subclasses.


For attributes, methods and constructors:

    public    : The code is accessible for all classes.
    private   : The code is only accessible within the declared class. (not even child class can access, use getter setter, see OOP tag_encapsulation)
    default   : The code is only accessible in the same package. This is used when you don't specify a modifier.
    protected : The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses (inheritance classes).



====== NON-ACCESS MODIFIERS ======
// ~!final ~!abstract ~!transient ~!synchronized ~!volatile

For classes:

    final    : The class cannot be inherited by other classes.
    abstract : The class cannot be used to create objects (To access an abstract class, it must be inherited by another class.)
       + static (Nested Classes +) : A 'static' inner class can be accessed directly without first creating an object of the outer class.


For attributes and methods:

    final        : Attributes and methods cannot be overridden/modified.
    static       : Attributes and methods belongs to the class, rather than an object (Math.abs(x)) (memory location, ref: tag_static)
                   (Accessed without obj creation)
    abstract     : Can only be used in an abstract class, and can ONLY be used on METHODS. The method does not have a body,
                     for example 'abstract void run();'. The body is provided by the subclass (inherited).
    transient    : Attributes and methods are skipped when serializing the object containing them.
    synchronized : Methods can only be accessed by one thread at a time.
    volatile     : The value of an attribute is not cached thread-locally, and is always read from the "main memory".

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // create an object of the Student class (which inherits attributes and methods from Main)
        Student myObj = new Student();

        System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.fname);
        System.out.println("Age: " + myObj.age);
        System.out.println("Graduation Year: " + myObj.graduationYear);
        myObj.study();        // call abstract method
  }
}



============================================================================================================================================ ~!STATIC

static: Used with methods, variables (class variables/attributes), blocks({..}), Nested class.

It mainly deals with the memory location management. Say a 'static' class method, it call be
directly called with the class without initialising the object. (i.e. Math.pow(x,y))
This is because the method/attribute/block has the same memory location as the class, they're
directly linked to the class. The static variable gets memory only once in the class area at the
time of class loading. Which means that in order to use them, you do not need to create a
memory location for them (the objects), aka initialising (i.e. Scanner obj = new Scanner(params); ).
To boil down, it makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).


PS: Anything 'static' in java will have a memory location, BUT JUST ONE, WITH EVERY OTHER RELATED CODE
    LINKED TO IT, which means that it will not have to go through the initialisation process.
    Anything 'non-static' will have to go through the initialisation process to get a memory location
    before being able to run.

NOTE: MAIN POWERS OF 'STATIC'
    - can be called without obj creation, since in the storage memory, they're bound to classes instead of obj.
NOTE: MAIN RESTRICTIONS OF 'STATIC'
    - Static methods can not use non-static data member or call non-static method directly. (must go through a bridge.)
    - 'this' and 'super' cannot be used in static context.

#ref: static - memory location.png



1. STATIC ATTRIBUTES
    We said that 'static' things only get memory once/ only one memory. Say an obj's code
    have it's value changed, then it will to change, but at the same memory location.

    []    class Counter2{
    []        static int count=0;//will get memory only once and retain its value
    []
    []            Counter2(){
    []                count++;//incrementing the value of static variable
    []                System.out.println(count);
    []            }
    []
    []        public static void main(String args[]){
    []            //creating objects
    []            Counter2 c1=new Counter2();
    []            Counter2 c2=new Counter2();
    []            Counter2 c3=new Counter2();
    []            }
    []    }
    []
    []    >>> 1
    []    >>> 2
    []    >>> 3


2. STATIC METHODS
    There are two main restrictions for the static method. They are:
        - The static method can not use non-static data member or call non-static method directly. (must go through a bridge.)
        - 'this' and 'super' cannot be used in static context. ??


3. STATIC ~!BLOCKS
    First of all, initializer blocks are codes located in blocks{} within the class definition/declaration. They are
    used to 'do something' before ANY init method / constructors of the class is called. A class can have any number
    of static initialization blocks, and they can appear anywhere in the class body. The runtime system guarantees
    that static initialization blocks are called in the order that they appear in the source code.
    A static block helps to initialize the static data members, just like constructors help to initialize instance
    members (aka attributes). Static blocks CAN'T work with non-static things.

    NOTE: In nested classes, for a 'STATIC' inner class that does not require initialisation, the static block of the
          inner class will also run, ONLY before anything of the 'STATIC' inner class is called.

    []    public class Demo {
    []        static int a;  <--static attributes
    []        static int b;
    []
    []        static {       <--static block
    []            a = 10;
    []            b = 20;
    []         }
    []        public static void main(String args[]) {
    []            System.out.println("Value of a = " + a);
    []            System.out.println("Value of b = " + b);
    []     	}
    []    }
    []    >>> Value of a = 10
    []    >>> Value of b = 20



============================================================================================================================================ ~!MAIN()
Just some Q&A about the main() method..

1. Why is java 'main()' method public?
    ANS: We know that anyone can access/invoke a method having public access specifier. The main method is public
    in Java because it has to be invoked by the JVM. So, if main() is not public in Java, the JVM can't call it.
    Thus, program can't be executed.

2. Why is the Java 'main' method static?
    ANS: In any Java program, the main() method is the starting point from where compiler starts program execution.
    So, the compiler needs to call the main() method. If the main() is allowed to be non-static, then while calling
    the main() method JVM has to instantiate its class, in other words, it requires an object. While instantiating
    it has to call the constructor of that class, there will be ambiguity if the constructor of that class takes an argument.
    Static method of a class can be called by using the class name only without creating an object of a class.
    The main() method in Java must be declared public, static and void. If any of these are missing, the Java program
    will compile but a runtime error will be thrown.

3. Why does java 'main()' method have a return type of void?
    ANS: Java main method doesn't return anything to anything, its function is just to contain and run the program,
    that's why it's return type is void. This has been done to keep things simple because once the main method is finished
    executing, java program terminates. So there is no point in returning anything, there is nothing that can be done
    for the returned object by JVM.

4. Can you rename the 'main()' method?
    ANS: No, you can't rename it. main() is a built-in name in java that JVM will find and call in order to execute
    your program.

5. What exactly is String [] args?
    ANS: It stores Java command line (passed in) arguments and is an array of type java.lang.String class. Here, the
    name of the String array is args but it is not fixed and user can use any name in place of it. Can be other data
    type array instead of String array only. (For main(), its recommended to use String[]varName)

    >>> javac Main.java
    >>> java Main 1 2 3 4 5               <-- See tag_NonScannerInput
    []    public class Main{
    []        public static void main(String[] args) {
    []            for (String elem : args)
    []                System.out.println(elem);
    []        }
    []    }
    >>> 1,2,3,4,5


============================================================================================================================================ ~!DATA TYPES
// ~!datatypes ~!var
                                Size
   byte var1 = 100;          // 1 byte    whole numbers from -128 to 127
  short var2 = 10000;        // 2 bytes   whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767
    int var3 = 5;            // 4 bytes   whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647
   long var4 = 1000000000L;  // 8 bytes   whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807
  float var5 = 3.1425f;      // 4 bytes   fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits
 double var6 = 1.23456789d;  // 8 bytes   fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits
boolean var7 = true;         // 1 bit     true or false
   char var9 = 'A';          // 2 bytes   a single character/letter or ASCII values (i.e. char a = 65; //'A')
String var10 = "blablabla";  // ???       Non-Primitive, refers to an object. All above are Primitive data types.
final double Pi = 3.142;     // Constants: Unchangable values once assigned. Throws Error when updated/reassigned.
^^^^^
      *L/f/d are used with long/float/double

NOTE: var name = AnyDataTypeValue; (makes it easy: do not have to pre-declare data type, data type is initialised by type of value assigned)
                                   (can also be used for containing inputted values, but only of the same data type, old value will be overridden.)

The main difference between ~!primitive and ~!non-primitive data types are:
	- Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and
	  is not defined by Java (except for String).
    - Primitive data types are like data values (requires wrapper class to be an obj), Non-Primitive data types are actually objs.
	- Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
	- A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
	- A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter,
	  just like defining classes, you start with an UPPERCASE letter (i.e. public class Trial {...} )
	  *Same as Python object & classes.
	- The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc.



================================================================================ ~!TYPE CASTING
// ~!typecasting ~!casting

Type casting is when you assign a value of one primitive data type to another type.
In Java, there are two types of casting:

	1. Widening Casting (automatically) - converting a smaller type to a larger type size
	  byte -> short -> char -> int -> long -> float -> double

	  []  int myInt = 9;
      []  double myDouble = myInt; // Automatic casting: int to double 9.0
      * can also be used as: (double)int

	2. Narrowing Casting (manually) - converting a larger type to a smaller size type
	  double -> float -> long -> int -> char -> short -> byte

	  []  double myDouble = 9.78d;
      []  int myInt = (int) myDouble; // Manual casting: double to int 9



================================================================================ ~!WRAPPER CLASSES
// ~!wrapperclasses ~!wrapclasses

Wrapper classes provide a way to use primitive data types (int, boolean, etc..) as objects.
(primitive data types usually treated as 'data type values')
The table below shows the primitive type and the equivalent wrapper class:

Primitive Data Type    Wrapper Class

               byte    Byte
              short    Short
                int    Integer
               long    Long
              float    Float
             double    Double
            boolean    Boolean
               char    Character

          *String is already an obj.

Sometimes you must use wrapper classes, for example when working with Collection objects, such
as ArrayList, where primitive types cannot be used (the list can only store objects):

Example
[]    ArrayList<int> myNumbers = new ArrayList<int>();         // Invalid - stores objs not data values
[]    ArrayList<Integer> myNumbers = new ArrayList<Integer>(); // Valid

Wrapper Objects are treated regularly like other data type values.

[]    Integer myObj = 5;
[]    System.out.println(myObj);
[]    >>> 5

Or you can use certain methods to retrieve the objects' information (values), since you are working with objs.
For example, the following methods are used to get the value associated with the corresponding wrapper object:
intValue(), byteValue(), shortValue(), longValue(), floatValue(), doubleValue(), charValue(), booleanValue().

[]    Integer myObj = 5;
[]    System.out.println(myObj.intValue());
[]    >>> 5

obj.toString();
Returns a string 'textual representation' of the object that should be a concise but informative representation
that is easy for a person to read. It is recommended that all subclasses override this method.

[]    Integer myInt = 100;                  // wrapper class objs
[]    String myString = myInt.toString();   // string value "100"

   char re = name.charAt(4);                      >>> B
    int re = name.indexOf("o");                   >>> 6
boolean re = name.isEmpty();                      >>> false
 String re = name.toUpperCase();
 String re = name.toLowerCase();
 String re = name.trim();                         >>> "Bro" (only spaces in front & behind string)

      >>> java Main 1 2 3 4    //run it and pass in args as if it is a part of a program.



============================================================================================================================================ ~!IF / WHILE / DO / FOR / FOR-EACH
// ~!if ~!else ~!while ~!do ~!for ~!foreach

1. IF / ELSE IF /ELSE
	[]	if (condition1) {
	[]		// code block;
	[]	} else if (condition2) {
	[]		// code block;
	[]	} else {
	[]		// code block;
	[]	}


2. WHILE-LOOP
	[]	while (i<6) {
	[]		// code block;
	[]	}


3. THE ~!DO/WHILE LOOP
	The do/while loop is a variant of the while loop. This loop will execute the code block once, before
	checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.

	Syntax
	[]	do {
	[]	  // code block to be executed;
	[]	}
	[]	while (condition);

	i.e.
	[]	int i = 0;
	[]	do {
	[]	  System.out.println(i);
	[]	  i++;
	[]	}
	[]	while (i < 5);
	[]	>>> 0,1,2,3,4


4. FOR-LOOP
	Syntax

	[]	for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3) {
	[]	  // code block to be executed
	[]	}

	Statement 1 is executed (one time) before the execution of the code block.
	Statement 2 defines the condition for executing the code block.
	Statement 3 is executed (every time) after the code block has been executed.

	i.e.
	[]	for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
	[]	  System.out.println(i);
	[]	}
	[]	>>> 0,1,2,3,4


5. FOR-EACH LOOP (Array)
	There is also a "for-each" loop, which is used exclusively to loop through elements in an array,
	just like in Python (for i in arr: print(i))

	Syntax
	[]	for (whats_inside_array var : arrayName) {
	[]	  // code block to be executed
	[]	}

	i.e.
	[]	String[] cars = {"Volvo", "BMW", "Ford", "Mazda"};
	[]	for (String i : cars) {
	[]	  System.out.println(i);
	[]	}
	[]	>>> Volvo, BMW, Ford, Mazda

    i.e.
    []  int[][] num  = {{1,2,3,4},{5,6,7}};
    []  for (int[] i : num) {
    []      for (int j : i){
    []          System.out.println(j);


============================================================================================================================================ ~!SHORT HAND IF / TERNARY OPERATOR
// ~!shorthandif ~!ternaryoperator

Short Hand If...Else (Ternary Operator)
There is also a short-hand if else, which is known as the ternary operator because it consists of three operands.
It can be used to replace multiple lines of code with a single line. It is often used to replace simple if else statements:

Syntax

[]	variable = (condition) ? TrueValue : FalseValue;

i.e.
[]	int time = 20;
[]	String result = (time < 18) ? "Good day." : "Good evening.";
[]	System.out.println(result);
[]	>>> Good evening.

instead of

[]	int time = 20;
[]	if (time < 18) {
[]	  System.out.println("Good day.");
[]	} else {
[]	  System.out.println("Good evening.");
[]	}
[]  >>> Good evening.



============================================================================================================================================ ~!SWITCH STATEMENT
// ~!case ~!switch
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

Syntax

[]	switch (expression) {
[]	  case val1:
[]	    // code block;
[]	    break;
[]	  case val2: case val3:     <-- can have same operation for diff case
[]	    // code block;
[]	    break;
[]	  default:
[]	    // code block;
[]	}

This is how it works:  The switch expression is evaluated once.
                       The value of the expression is compared with the values of each case.
                       If there is a match, the associated block(s) of code is executed.
                       The break and default keywords are optional, break is to save time by
					     ignoring other cases by jumping out of the switch block.
					   'default' is more like an 'else' statement, executed when no case matches.
					     *default IS the LAST CASE, doesn't require 'break'.

[]	int day = 4;
[]	switch (day) {
[]	  case 6:
[]	    System.out.println("Today is Saturday");
[]	    break;
[]	  case 7:
[]	    System.out.println("Today is Sunday");
[]	    break;
[]    case 8: case 9:
[]      System.out.println("How high are you?");
[]	  default:
[]	    System.out.println("Looking forward to the Weekend");
[]	}
[]	// Outputs "Looking forward to the Weekend"


============================================================================================================================================ ~!BREAK / CONTINUE

============================================================================================================================================ ~!ARRAYLIST
The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util package. The difference between
a built-in array and an ArrayList in Java, is that the size of an array cannot be modified (if you want to add
or remove elements to/from an array, you have to create a new one). While elements can be added and removed from
an ArrayList whenever you want. NOTE: ArrayList stores objects, thus a wrapper class is required for Primitive
Data Types (see tag_wrapperclasses). The declaration syntax is also slightly different:

[]    import java.util.ArrayList;                           // import the ArrayList class
[]    ArrayList<Integer> cars = new ArrayList<Integer>();   // Create an ArrayList object
[]               ^ wrapper class


Some example code and some methods of ArrayList class objs.

[]    import java.util.ArrayList;
[]    public class Main {
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();       // creates 'cars' ArrayList
[]
[]            cars.add("Volvo");                                      // adds values (auto wrapped by wrapper class)
[]            cars.add("BMW");
[]            cars.add("Ford");
[]            cars.add("Mazda");
[]
[]            cars.add(0, "Lykan");                                  // adds value to specified index position, pushes others behind
[]

[]            System.out.println(cars.get(0));                        // returns objs at passed index position
[]
[]            cars.set(0, "Opel");                                    // sets new obj to specified index position
[]
[]            cars.remove(0);                                         // removes obj at specified index position
[]

[]
[]            System.out.println(cars.size());                        // returns ArrayList size/length
[]
[]            for (int i = 0; i < cars.size(); i++) {                 // ordinary for-loop
[]                System.out.println(cars.get(i));
[]            }
[]            for (String i : cars) {                                 // for-each loop
[]                System.out.println(i);

[]                                                                       performs tag_lambda expression task for every elem
[]                                                                       of the Iterable.
[]        }
[]    }

In order to ~!sort an ArrayList, we need the help of another class: java.util.Collections
Sorts items based by comparing objects. Throws 'ClassCastException' for items of different
classes. NOTE: for String objs, sorts numerical before alphabetical.

[]    import java.util.ArrayList;
[]    import java.util.Collections;        // Import the Collections class
[]    public class Main {
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            ArrayList<String> cars = new ArrayList<String>();
[]            cars.add("Volvo");
[]            cars.add("BMW");
[]            cars.add("Ford");
[]            cars.add("Mazda");
[]            Collections.sort(cars);      // Sort cars
[]            System.out.println(cars);
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> [BMW, Ford, Mazda, Volvo]




============================================================================================================================================ ~!LINKEDLIST
A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations (random).
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link/pointer) to
the next node in the list. Structure wise:

    [C01](link) --> [C02](link) --> [C03](link) --> [C04](link) --> Null
    ^               ^^^^^^^^^^^
    Node Head       Node


--- ArrayList vs. LinkedList ---
The LinkedList class is a collection which can contain many objects of the same type, just like the ArrayList. The
LinkedList class has all of the same methods as the ArrayList class because they both implement the List interface.
This means that you can add items, change items, remove items and clear the list in the same way.
However, while the ArrayList class and the LinkedList class can be used in the same way, they are built very differently.

How the ArrayList works:  [ Data stored together at same memory location, otherwise in continuous memory locations. ]
                          The ArrayList class has a regular array inside it. When an element is added, it is placed into
                          the array. If the array is not big enough, a new, larger array is created to replace the old one
                          and the old one is removed.

How the LinkedList works: [ Data distributed to random memory locations, but contains links/address to the next Data. ]
                          The LinkedList stores its items in "containers." The list has a link to the first container and
                          each container has a link to the next container in the list. To add an element to the list, the
                          element is placed into a new container and that container is linked to one of the other containers
                          in the list.

NOTE: When To Use: Use an ArrayList for storing and accessing data, and LinkedList to manipulate data.


For many cases, the ArrayList is more efficient as it is common to need access to random items in the list, but the LinkedList
provides several methods to do certain operations more efficiently like : addFirst(), addLast(), removeFirst(), removeLast(),
getFirst(), getLast(), ... etc. Methods of Java LinkedList are very similar (mostly same) to ArrayList. See all methods at:
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html#removeFirstOccurrence(java.lang.Object)

[]    import java.util.LinkedList;
[]    public class Main {

============================================================================================================================================ ~!HASHMAP
// ~!dictionary
Hash-Collection: HashTable, HashMap, HashSet

ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html

HashMap implements the 'Map' interface. The HashMap class is roughly equivalent to Hashtable,
except that it is unsynchronized and permits nulls.)It stores items in "key/value" pairs
(like Python dictionaries) It can store different types: String keys and Integer values, .. etc.

NOTE: There's no guarantee that the order of 'key-value' pairs will remain constant over time.
NOTE: HashMap elements are filtered through a 'Hashing Algorithm / Hash Table / hashCode()', which
      provides them with a special key (index) for each element. Thus, DUPLICATES are NOT ALLOWED.
      Null element can be used as 'key-value' pairs.
NOTE: To successfully store and retrieve objects from a Hash-Collection, the objects used as keys must
      implement the hashCode() method and the equals() method from Java.lang.object:
      https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/override-equalsobject-hashcode-method/

============================================================================================================================================ ~!HASHTABLE
Hash-Collection: HashTable, HashMap, HashSet

ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Hashtable.html

The Hashtable class implements a hash table, which maps keys to values. Any non-null object can be
used as a key or as a value. NOTE: To successfully store and retrieve objects from a Hash-Collection, the
objects used as keys must implement the hashCode() method and the equals() method from Java.lang.object:
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/override-equalsobject-hashcode-method/

It is similar to HashMap, but is synchronized. Hashtable stores key/value pair in hash table. In Hashtable
we specify an object that is used as a key, and the value we want to associate to that key. The key is then
hashed, and the resulting hash code is used as the index at which the value is stored within the table.




============================================================================================================================================ ~!HASHSET
Hash-Collection: HashTable, HashMap, HashSet

ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/HashMap.html

HashSet implements the 'Set' interface, backed by a hash table (actually a HashMap instance)
It is a collection of items where every item is unique (with its own Hash-Key)

NOTE: There's no guarantee that the order of elements will remain constant over time.
NOTE: HashSet elements are filtered through a 'Hashing Algorithm / Hash Table / hashCode()', which
      provides them with a special Hash-Key (hidden within the data structure) for each element.
      Thus, DUPLICATES are NOT ALLOWED. Null element can be used. You can access the elements
      with loops.
NOTE: To successfully store and retrieve objects from a Hash-Collection, the objects used as keys must
      implement the hashCode() method and the equals() method from Java.lang.object:
      https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/override-equalsobject-hashcode-method/

static - means that the method belongs to the Main class, not an object of the Main class.


// ~!methodoverloading
Method Overloading
With method overloading, multiple methods can have the SAME NAME with DIFFERENT PARAMETERS.
Which method is called is determined by the type of arguments passed.

[]    static int plusMethodInt(int x, int y) {
[]      return x + y;
[]    }
[]
[]    static double plusMethodDouble(double x, double y) {

[]      System.out.println("double: " + myNum2);
[]    }


// ~!scope
Method Scope
Variables declared directly inside a method are available anywhere ONLY in the method following the
line of code in which they were declared:

[]    public class Main {
[]      public static void main(String[] args) {
[]
[]            // Code here CANNOT use x
[]
[]        int x = 100;
[]
[]            // Code here can use x
[]        System.out.println(x);
[]      }
[]    }

Block Scope
A block of code refers to all of the code between curly braces {...}. Variables declared inside blocks of
code are only accessible by the code between the curly braces, which follows the line in which the variable
was declared. A block of code may exist on its own or it can belong to an if, while or for statement. In the
case of for statements, variables declared in the statement itself are also available inside the block's scope.

[]    public class Main {
[]      public static void main(String[] args) {
[]              // Code here CANNOT use x
[]
[]        {     // This is a block
[]              // Code here CANNOT use x
[]          int x = 100;
[]              // Code here CAN use x
[]          System.out.println(x);
[]        }     // The block ends here
[]
[]              // Code here CANNOT use x
[]      }
[]    }



// ~!Recursion
Adding two numbers together is easy to do, but adding a range of numbers is more complicated. In the following
example, recursion is used to add a range of numbers together by breaking it down into the simple task of adding
two numbers.

Example Explained
When the sum() function is called, it adds parameter k to the sum of all numbers smaller than k and returns the
result. When k becomes 0, the function just returns 0. When running, the program follows these steps:

[]    public class Main {                               Returned  Equation
[]      public static void main(String[] args) {            9     10 + sum(9)
[]        int result = sum(10);                             8     10 + ( 9 + sum(8) )
[]        System.out.println(result);                       7     10 + ( 9 + ( 8 + sum(7) ) )
[]      }                                                  ...    ...
[]      public static int sum(int k) {                      0     10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + sum(0)
[]        if (k > 0) {                                      0     10 + 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 + 1 + 0
[]          return k + sum(k - 1);                      *If you return the function itself, then you call it again.
[]        } else {                                      Halting Condition: k = 0
[]          return 0;
[]        }
[]      }
[]    }

Halting Condition
Just as loops can run into the problem of infinite looping, recursive functions can run into the problem of
infinite recursion. Infinite recursion is when the function never stops calling itself. Every recursive function
should have a halting condition, which is the condition where the function stops calling itself. In the previous
example, the halting condition is when the parameter k becomes 0.



============================================================================================================================================ ~!TRY / CATCH / FINALLY
// ~!try ~!catch() ~!finally ~!errors

Exceptions list and details: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Exception.html

try{
    // some code
} catch (Exception1 e){
    // some code
} catch (Exception2 e){
    // some code
} finally{
    // executed regardless of result
}

NOTE: for general purposes, use 'catch (Exception e)'


NOTE: Java will throw different Exceptions for different errors. You can catch all Exceptions generally
using 'catch(Exception e)' or catch different Exceptions seperately or togther as below:

[]    try {
[]        ...
[]    } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
[]        someCode();
[]    } catch (SecurityException e) {
[]        someCode();
[]    } catch (IllegalAccessException e) {
[]        someCode();
[]    } catch (NoSuchFieldException e) {
[]        someCode();
[]    }

[]    try {
[]      ...
[]    } catch (IllegalArgumentException | SecurityException | IllegalAccessException |
[]                NoSuchFieldException e) {
[]      someCode();
[]    }


NOTE: The ~!throw statement allows you to create a custom error. The throw statement is used together with an exception type.
There are many exception types available in Java: ArithmeticException, FileNotFoundException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException,
SecurityException, ..etc.

[]    public class Main {
[]        static void checkAge(int age) {
[]            if (age < 18) {
[]                throw new ArithmeticException("Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.");   // ERROR_TYPE & Optional Message
[]            } else {
[]                System.out.println("Access granted - You are old enough!");
[]            }
[]        }
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            checkAge(15);
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> Exception in thread "main" java.lang.ArithmeticException: Access denied - You must be at least 18 years old.
[]            at Main.checkAge(Main.java:4)
[]            at Main.main(Main.java:10)

The e.printStackTrace() method in Java is a tool used to handle exceptions and errors. It is a method of Java’s throwable class
which prints the throwable along with other details like the line number and class name where the exception occurred.
It is very much equivalent to 'System.out.println(e)', but provides much more details about the error.

[]    class Program {
[]        public static void foo() {
[]            try {
[]                int num1 = 5/0;

[]            foo();
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> java.lang.ArithmeticException: / by zero

[]    class Program {

============================================================================================================================================ ~!PACKAGES / API
// ~!import ~!api

Directory: random C://...
             |--- Package Name           OR     |--- Package Name           *You can have 0 or infinite sub-packages.
               |--- Sub-Package Name              |--- ClassFile.java
                 |--- ClassFile.java

To Create Package:
[]  package packagename.subpackage;
[]  public class John {
[]      //class code;
[]  }

To Import Package:
[]  import package.subpackage.ClassName;   // Import a single class
[]  import package.subpackage.*;           // Import the whole package


For example in 'random_file.java':
[]  import School.5A1.John
Package directory: C:/...../School/5A1/John.java

The Thing about Java Packages:
    - In the first line of John.java, you must write 'package School.5A1;'. Java uses a 'directory' system for packages.
    - The WHOLE 'School' folder must be located at the same directory as the 'random_file.java' that is going to import it.
    - You must compile all the used classes/.java via the terminal: 'javac file.java', one-by-one? (use 'cd' & 'cd -')
    * IMPORTANT: the package folder is encouraged to contain the 'John.java' source code. (John.class is created after compiling.)

Option: The 'John.java' and other source codes of the package can also be in the same directory as the 'random_file.java' that
        imports it. However, you must compile them via the terminal: 'javac -d . John.java'. It will then create a 'virtual'
        folder of the package (compiled, containing .class files) that is ready to be used.

* A few classes/classname.java in the same directory can work together without importing, provided they're not packages.

============================================================================================================================================ ~!REGEX / ~!ESCAPE CHAR
NOTE: Majority of symbols & match characters are similar to Python REGEX.
      Matcher characters in Java like '\d' are used like this '\\d'
      Full at https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html (Downloaded)

How To: Pattern obj is used to store info about the search pattern,
        which is then used with the Matcher obj to perform search &
        other operations.
A typical invocation sequence:
    []    Pattern p = Pattern.compile("REpattern");
    []    Matcher m = p.matcher("StringToMatch/Search");
    []    boolean b = m.matches();
is equivalent to
    []    boolean b = Pattern.matches("REpattern", "StrinToMatch/Search");

Modifier and Type	Method and Description
=================   =======================================================================
boolean	            .find​()
                          Attempts to find the next subsequence of the input sequence
                          that matches the pattern. Matcher obj moves to next match.
                          (append position moved: One-Time Iterator sort-of)
boolean	            .find​(int start)
                          Resets this matcher and then attempts to find the next subsequence
                          of the input sequence that matches the pattern, starting at the
                          specified index. (append position moved: One-Time Iterator sort-of)
String	            .group​()
                          Returns the input subsequence matched by the previous match.
String	            .group​(int group)
                          Returns the input subsequence captured by the given group during
                          the previous match operation.
boolean	            .matches​()
                          Attempts to match the entire region against the pattern.
Pattern	            .pattern​()
                          Returns the pattern that is interpreted by this matcher.
Matcher	            .reset​(OPTIONAL StringToSearch)
                          Resets this matcher (including append position) / with a new
                          input sequence.
String	            .replaceAll​(String replacement)
                          Replaces every subsequence of the input sequence that matches
                          the pattern with the given replacement string.


=== ~!GROUPS AND CAPTURING ================================================================
Group number: Capturing groups (Python Sub-Groups) are numbered by counting their opening
              parentheses from left to right. In the expression ((A)(B(C))), for example,
              there are four such groups:

1    	((A)(B(C)))
2    	(A)
3    	(B(C))
4    	(C)
*'0' always stands for the entire expression.

Capturing groups are so named because, during a match, each subsequence of the input sequence
that matches such a group is saved. The captured subsequence may be used later in the expression,
via a back reference, and may also be retrieved from the matcher once the match operation is complete.
NOTE: Accessed using Matcher.group(int group); ^

============================================================================================================================================ ~!THREADS
public class Thread
extends Object
implements Runnable
ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/lang/Thread.html

Threads allows a program to operate more efficiently by doing multiple things at the same time. Threads can be
used to perform complicated tasks in the background without interrupting the main program.

Every thread has a ~!priority. Threads with higher priority are executed in preference to threads with lower
priority. (used by Thread scheduler to decide which thread should be allowed to execute.) When code running in
some thread creates a new Thread object, the new thread has its priority initially set equal to the priority of
the creating thread, and is a daemon thread if and only if the creating thread is a daemon.

Below code is mostly done by Java developers.
    []    public class Thread extends object, implements Runnable {
    []        public static final int   MAX_PRIORITY = 10;
    []        public static final int   MIN_PRIORITY = 1;
    []        public static final int   NORM_PRIORITY = 5;
    []
    []        public void setPriority(int newPriority){       <-- Set method definition
    []            this.PRIORITY = newPriority;
    []        }
    []    }

Each thread may or may not also be marked as a ~!daemon. A daemon thread is a thread that does not prevent (allows)
the JVM from exiting when the program finishes but the thread is still running. An example for a daemon thread is
the garbage collection. You can use the setDaemon(boolean) method to change the Thread daemon properties before the
thread starts.

When a Java Virtual Machine starts up, there is usually a single non-daemon thread (which typically calls the method
named 'main' of some designated class). The Java Virtual Machine continues to execute threads until either of the
following occurs:

    - The exit method of class Runtime has been called and the security manager has permitted the exit operation to
      take place.
    - All threads that are not daemon threads have died, either by returning from the call to the run method or by
      throwing an exception that propagates beyond the run method.

NOTE: To create a Thread object, do as below:
  1. 'Class extends Thread' or 'Class implements Runnable'. (Second option allows you to extend other classes)
  2. @Override Thread/Runnable's 'public void run()' method, which is in turn called by Thread.start().
     (Insert code to be run in the background here)


=== Extends Thread class ===
[]    public class Main extends Thread {            <-- Main already has properties of Thread (Inherited)
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {        that's why just directly use Main class obj.start();
[]            Main thread = new Main();                <-- Create threat obj
[]            thread.start();                          <-- calls run()
[]            System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
[]        }
[]    @Override
[]    public void run() {
[]        System.out.println("Insert code to be run in the background here");
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> Insert code to be run in the background here
[]    >>> This code is outside of the thread


=== Implements Runnable interface ===
[]    public class Main implements Runnable {                    <-- Optional 'extends OtherClass'
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Main obj = new Main();                             <-- Create class (Runnable) obj
[]            Thread thread = new Thread(obj, "OptThreadName");    <-- Pass in 'Runnable' obj to create Thread obj ()
[]            thread.start();                                    <-- calls run()
[]            System.out.println("This code is outside of the thread");
[]        }
[]        @Override
[]        public void run() {
[]            System.out.println("Insert code to be run in the background here");
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> Insert code to be run in the background here
[]    >>> This code is outside of the thread


--- ~!Concurrency Problems ---
Because threads run at the same time as other parts of the program, there is no way to know in which order the code will
run. When the threads and main program are reading and writing the same variables, the values are unpredictable. The
problems that result from this are called concurrency problems.

To avoid concurrency problems, it is best to share as few attributes between threads as possible. If attributes need to
be shared, one possible solution is to use the isAlive() method of the thread to check whether the thread has finished
running before using any attributes that the thread can change.

[]    public class Main extends Thread {
[]        public static int amount = 0;
[]
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Main thread = new Main();
[]            thread.start();
[]
[]            while(thread.isAlive()) {              <-- wait for thread process to end
[]                System.out.println("Waiting...");
[]            }
[]            System.out.println("Thread: " + amount);
[]
[]            amount++;                              <-- code from main
[]            System.out.println("Main: " + amount);
[]        }
[]        public void run() {
[]            amount++;
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> Waiting...
[]    >>> Thread: 1
[]    >>> Main: 2

============================================================================================================================================ ~!LAMBDA EXPRESSIONS
// ~!lambdaexpressions

A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value.
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be
implemented right in the body of a method. Syntax:

    1.    (DataType OneParameter) -> expression;
    2.    (DataType parameter1, DataType parameter2) -> expression;

Expressions are limited. They have to immediately return a value, and they cannot contain
variables, assignments or statements such as 'if' or 'for'. In order to do more complex operations,
a code block can be used with curly braces. If the lambda expression needs to return a value,
then the code block should have a return statement.

    3.    (DataType parameter1, DataType parameter2) -> { //code block ; }

Some sample code;
    []    import java.util.ArrayList;
    []    public class Main {
    []        public static void main(String[] args) {
    []            ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
    []            numbers.add(5);
    []            numbers.add(9);
    []            numbers.add(8);
    []            numbers.add(1);
    []            numbers.forEach( (n) -> { System.out.println(n); } );
    []        }
    []    }



=== Using Lambda Expressions With Functional Interfaces ===
-----------------------------------------------------------
ref: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/functional-interfaces-java/
NOTE: lambda expression must return the same DataType as described by Interface Method.
      Thus, most of the time the 'lambda expression - interface' method is called in
      other methods.

// ~!functionalinterface
A functional interface is an interface that contains only one abstract method (body undefined)
for the use of lambda expressions. They can have only one functionality to exhibit, which is to
act as a DataType for containing lambda expressions. The 'java.util.function' package contains
many built-in functional interfaces like 'Predicate', 'BinaryOperator', 'Function', 'Consumer'.

@FunctionalInterface annotation is used to ensure that the functional interface can’t have more
than one abstract method. In case more than one abstract methods are present, the compiler flags
an ‘Unexpected @FunctionalInterface annotation’ message. However, it is not mandatory to use this
annotation. Example:

    []    @FunctionalInterface
    []    interface StringFunction {
    []        String run(String str);
    []    }

From Java 8 onwards, lambda expressions can be used to represent / assigned as the object of a
functional interface (Java 8 onwards). Example:

    []    StringFunction exclaim = (String s) -> s + "!";
    []    StringFunction ask = (String s) -> s + "?";
                               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Some sample code about how the whole system works:

    []    @FunctionalInterface
    []    interface StringFunction {        1. Functional Interface as DataType to contain lambda expressions
    []        String run(String str);       2. abstract method that will run the lambda expression when called
    []    }                                    How? The lambda expression acts as the body of the method.
    []                                         The lambda expression is mapped onto the method based on its
    []                                         args DataType & return value DataType.
    []
    []    public class Main {
    []        public static void main(String[] args) {
    []            StringFunction exclaim = (String s) -> s + "!";        3. Assigning lambda expression as object of Functional Interface
    []            StringFunction ask = (String s) -> s + "?";
    []            printFormatted("Hello", exclaim);                      6. Using the defined 'printFormatted()' method
    []            printFormatted("Hello", ask);
    []        }
    []        public static void printFormatted(String str, StringFunction obj) {     4. Defining method that will take in String & Interface object as args
    []            String result = obj.run(str);                                       5. 'obj.run()' method will call the lambda expression
    []            System.out.println(result);
    []        }
    []    }

There are many available classes in the Java API that can be used to read and write files in
Java: FileReader, BufferedReader, Files, Scanner, FileInputStream, FileWriter, BufferedWriter,
FileOutputStream, etc. Which one to use depends on the Java version you're working with and
whether you need to read bytes or characters, and the size of the file/lines etc.

[]    NOTE: Quick Summary
[]    File       : Create, Read, GetInfo, Delete
[]    FileWriter : Write

The File class from the java.io package, allows us to work with files. To use the File class,
create an object of the class, and specify the filename or directory name:

[]    import java.io.File;                   // Import the File class
[]    import java.io.FileWriter;             // Import the FileWriter class
[]    import java.io.FileNotFoundException;  // Import this class to handle errors
[]    import java.io.IOException;            // Import the IOException class to handle errors
[]    import java.util.Scanner;              // Import the Scanner class to read text files
[]    ...
[]    File myObj = new File("/path/filename.txt");   // Mac & Linux

// OOP: Object Oriented Programming

Alright, some important info first shall we?

1.  In python, a .py file can have multiple classes. In java you can only have ONE 'PUBLIC' class in every .java file, and the
    filename should match the 'public' class' name. A .java file is called a compilation unit. Each compilation unit may contain
    any number of top-level classes and interfaces, provided that ONLY ONE of them is public. If there are no public top-level
    types then the compilation unit can be named anything. However, if there is a public top-level class, then the file name must
    be the same as the class name. Usually cases such as below occur:
        - A public class with other non-public class (support classes to the public)
        - Multiple non-public classes that work together.
    * A few classes/classname.java in the same directory can work together without importing.


// ~!this
2.  In python you use 'self' to refer to the object's/class' instance. In java, you use 'this'. Same functionality, just that you
    do not need to pass it into the method parammeters.
    NOTE: 'this' can ONLY be used with NON-STATIC methods & attributes. STATIC things doesn't have objs.
    []
    []    public int method(params){    instead of     def method(self, params):
    []        this.attribute = 0;                          self.attribute = 0
    []    }
    Another use of 'this' is that when you have multiple constructors (init) for a single class, you can use 'this(arg0, arg1, ...)' to
    call another constructor of your choosing, provided you do so in the first line of your constructor, and pass in the arguments that
    the 'wanted' constructor requires.
    []
    []    class Foo {
    []        public Foo() {
    []            this("String value. This init calls the below init");
    []            //just like creating/init an obj in python: obj1 = Foo(params_of_init)
    []        }
    []
    []        public Foo(String VAL1) {
    []            // Do something with VAL1
    []        }
    []    }
    One more use of 'this' is when accessing an outer instance from a nested non-static class:
    []
    []    public class Outer {
    []        protected int a;
    []
    []        public class Inner {
    []            protected int a;
    []
    []            public int foo(){
    []                return Outer.this.a;    <--
    []            }
    []
    []            public Outer getOuter(){    <--
    []                return Outer.this;
    []            }
    []        }
    []    }


============================================================================================================================================ ~!WARMUP /OOP
// OOP
Some general warm-up code?

[]    public class Main {
[]        // attribute
[]        final int x = 10;
[]        int y;
[]
[]        // STATIC method, ref: tag_static
[]        //           Also see: tag_methodoverloading
[]        static void myStaticMethod() {
[]            System.out.println("Static methods can be called without creating objects");
[]        }
[]
[]        // NON-STATIC method
[]        // NOTE: 'this' can ONLY be used with NON-STATIC methods & attributes. STATIC things doesn't have objs.
[]        public void myPublicMethod() {
[]            this.y = 20;
[]            System.out.println("Public methods must be called by creating objects " + this.y);
[]        }

[]        //** MAIN.
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Main myObj = new Main();
[]            myObj.x = 25;                     // will generate an error: cannot assign a value to a final variable
[]            System.out.println(myObj.x);
[]
[]            Main.myStaticMethod();            // Call the static method
[]            myStaticMethod();                 // optional without class call
[]                                              // myPublicMethod(); This would compile an error
[]
[]            Main myObj = new Main();          // Create an object of Main
[]            myObj.myPublicMethod();           // Call the public method on the object
[]        }
[]    }
[]
[]    >>> ERROR: Cannot assign value to a final variable
[]    >>> 10
[]    >>> Static methods can be called without creating objects
[]    >>> Static methods can be called without creating objects
[]    >>> Public methods must be called by creating objects 20




============================================================================================================================================ ~!CLASSES /OOP
// OOP
Two classes can work together just as in Python, but in java they have to be in separate files, provided
that they are located at the same directory. (i.e. 'Main.java' 'Second.java')

====== Main.java ======
[]    public class Main {
[]      public void fullThrottle() {
[]        System.out.println("The car is going as fast as it can!");
[]      }
[]
[]      public void speed(int maxSpeed) {
[]        System.out.println("Max speed is: " + maxSpeed);
[]      }
[]    }

====== Second.java ======
[]    class Second {
[]      public static void main(String[] args) {
[]        Main myCar = new Main();     // Create a myCar object
[]        myCar.fullThrottle();        // Call the fullThrottle() method
[]        myCar.speed(200);            // Call the speed() method
[]      }
[]    }

... javac Main.java
... javac Second.java
... java Second.java

>>> The car is going as fast as it can!
>>> Max speed is: 200

See more at: tag_packages


============================================================================================================================================ ~!CONSTRUCTORS /OOP
// OOP ~!init() ~!__init__()

Just like '__init__()' method in Python, a constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The
constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes.

NOTE: The constructor name must match the class name, and it CANNOT have a return type (like void).
All classes have constructors by default: if you do not create a class constructor yourself, Java creates one for you.
However, then you are not able to set initial values for object attributes.

NOTE: Initializer blocks run before constructors. See tag_blocks

[]    public class Main {
[]        int modelYear;
[]        String modelName;
[]
[]        public Main(int year, String name) {      <--Constructor __init__()
[]            modelYear = year;
[]            modelName = name;
[]        }
[]
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Main myCar = new Main(1969, "Mustang");
[]            System.out.println(myCar.modelYear + " " + myCar.modelName);
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> 1969 Mustang


====== METHOD OVERLOADING ======
As we've seen in method overloading, a class can have more than one constructor, provided that they take in
different parameters. Which constructor is called depends on the arguments passed in during initialisation of
the object.

[]    public class trial2{
[]        public int x;
[]        public trial2(){
[]            System.out.println("init 1 called");
[]        }
[]        public trial2(int x){
[]            this.x=x;
[]            System.out.println("init 2 called");
[]        }
[]        public static void main(String [] args){
[]            trial2 obj1 = new trial2();            <-- calls init 1
[]            trial2 obj2 = new trial2(5);           <-- calls init 2
[]        }
[]    }


====== METHOD ~!@OVERRIDING ======
ref: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/IandI/override.html
It lets the compiler double-check for you when you say (by annotating) that a specified method is supposed to
~!override a superclass method (or implement an interface method in Java 6 or later). If the method does not, in
fact, override a superclass method (or implement an interface method), the compiler will flag this as an error.
This often indicates that you have a typo in the method name or made a mistake in the method signature.
Need it? Absolutely not, but its such a cheap way to :
    - convey explicitly to human reader that this is an overriding method.
    - catch a bug at compile time that could take at least a few brain cycles to catch at run-time.

NOTE: The access specifier for an overriding method can allow more, but not less, access than the overridden method.
      For example, a protected instance method in the superclass can be made public, but not private, in the subclass.
NOTE: You can not @Override static methods in Java, however you can declare a method with the same signature in
      a subclass. It won't be overridden in the exact sense, instead, that is called method hiding.

The following table summarizes what happens when you define a method with the same signature as a method in a superclass.

 	                         Superclass Instance Method       Superclass Static Method
                         |--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
Subclass Instance Method | @Overrides                     | Generates a compile-time error |
Subclass Static Method   | Generates a compile-time error | Hides                          |
                         |--------------------------------|--------------------------------|


[]    public class random extends apple{
[]        @Override                         <--@Overriding non-static method
[]        public void num(int n){
[]            System.out.println("Hi "+n);
[]        }
[]        public static void main(String [] args){
[]            random obj = new random();
[]            obj.num(10);
[]        }
[]    }
[]    class apple{
[]        public void num(int n){
[]            n++;
[]        }
[]    }


====== CALLING INIT() IN ANOTHER INIT() ======
You can also call a different constructor from the inside of another constructor. When you have multiple constructors
(init) for a single class, you can use 'this(arg0, arg1, ...)' to call another constructor of your choosing, provided
you do so in the first line of your constructor, and pass in the arguments that the 'wanted' constructor requires.

[]    class Foo {
[]        public Foo() {
[]            this("String value. This init calls the below init");
[]            //just like creating/init an obj in python: obj1 = Foo(params_of_init)
[]        }
[]
[]        public Foo(String VAL1) {
[]            // Do something with VAL1
[]        }
[]    }

====== CALLING CONSTRUCTORS IN SUPERCLASSES ====== // ~!super()
In Java a class can extend another class. When a class extends another class it is also said to "inherit" from the class
it extends. The class that extends is called the subclass, and the class being extended is called the superclass.

[]    super(args)

NOTE: In Java, child class DOES NOT automatically inherit parent's __init__(), but in Python, they inherit it automatically.

--- Vehicle.java ---
[]    public class Vehicle {
[]        private String regNo = null;
[]
[]        public Vehicle(String no) {
[]            this.regNo = no;
[]        }
[]    }

--- Car.java ---
[]    public class Car extends Vehicle {
[]        private String brand = null;
[]
[]        public Car(String br, String no) {   <-- take in additional param for parent init()
[]            super(no);                       <-- calling parent init & passing in required args
[]            this.brand = br;                     In Python: Vehicle.__init__(self, args..)
[]        }                                               or: super().__init__(args..)
[]    }

============================================================================================================================================ ~!INHERITANCE /OOP
// OOP
subclass (child) - the class that inherits from another class
superclass (parent) - the class being inherited from

To inherit from a class, use the 'extends' keyword.

NOTE: Java doesn't allow multiple inheritance for classes, but Python allows lol.
      (See tag_interface for multiple inheritance)
NOTE: 'final' classes doesn't allow inheritance.
NOTE: In Java, child class DOES NOT automatically inherit parent's __init__(), but in Python, they inherit it automatically.
      In Java, use 'super(args);' to call the parent's init() and pass in the required args. (ref: tag_super())

--- Vehicle.java ---
[]    class Vehicle {
[]        protected String brand = "Ford";        // Vehicle attribute
[]        public void honk() {                    // Vehicle method
[]            System.out.println("Tuut, tuut!");
[]        }
[]    }

--- Car.java ---
[]    class Car extends Vehicle {
[]    // NOTE: can also be 'class Car extends OtherClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface'
[]    //       inheritance & implementation going on at the same time.
[]        private String modelName = "Mustang";    // Car attribute
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]
[]            // Create a myCar object
[]            Car myCar = new Car();
[]
[]            // Call the honk() method (from the Vehicle class) on the myCar object
[]            myCar.honk();
[]
[]            // Display the value of the brand attribute (from the Vehicle class) and the value of the modelName from the Car class
[]            System.out.println(myCar.brand + " " + myCar.modelName);
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> Tuut, tuut!
[]    >>> Ford Mustang


We set the brand attribute in Vehicle to a 'protected' (accessible in the same package and subclasses (inheritance classes))
If it was set to 'private', the Car class would not be able to access it.

NOTE: See also tag_nestedclassinheritance




============================================================================================================================================ ~!INNER CLASSES /OOP
// OOP ~!innerclasses ~!nestedclasses

In Java, it is also possible to nest classes (a class within a class). The purpose of nested classes is to group classes that
belong together, which makes your code more readable and maintainable. An inner class can be:

    - public / default /  private / protected
    - final / static / abstract


NOTE: Usually, you must first create an obj of the outer class, then from the outer obj, extend/create the inner obj.

================================================================================INHERITANCE OF NESTED CLASSES
// OOP ~!nestedclassinheritance ~!innerclassinheritance ~!nestedinheritance
There are a few cases:

1. In Same OuterClass: InnerOne extends InnerTwo
    []
    []    class OuterClass
    []    {
    []    	class InnerClassOne
    []    	{

    []    		}
    []    	}
    []
    []    	class InnerClassTwo extends InnerClassOne
    []    	{
    []            //One Inner Class can extend another inner class
    []    	}
    []    }


2. (Static/Non-Static) InnerClass extended by other OuterClass
    []
    []    class OuterClass
    []    {
    []    	static class InnerStatic {}

    []    class AnotherClassOne extends OuterClass.InnerStatic
    []    {

    []      // Belongs to OuterClass class, ref directly.
    []    }
    [] ------------------------------------------------------------
    []    class AnotherClassTwo extends OuterClass.InnerNonStatic
    []    {
    []    	public AnotherClassTwo()       <-- constructor
    []    	{
    []    		new OuterClass().super();  //accessing super class constructor through OuterClass instance
    []                                     // Belongs to OuterClass object, ref through Outerclass obj.
    []    	}

3. AnotherOuter extends Outer, AnotherInner extends Inner
    []    class OuterClass
    []    {
    []    	int x;

    []    	}
    []    }




============================================================================================================================================ ~!ENCAPSULATION /OOP
// OOP
Encapsulation is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users, an outside class has no access to it.
To achieve this, you must:
    - declare class variables/attributes as private
    - provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

--- Person.java ---
[]    public class Person {
[]        private String name; // private = restricted access
[]
[]        // Getter
[]        public String getName() {
[]            return name;
[]        }
[]
[]        // Setter
[]        public void setName(String newName) {
[]            this.name = newName;
[]        }
[]    }

--- Main.java ---
[]    public class Main {
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Person myObj = new Person();
[]            myObj.setName("John"); // Set the value of the name variable to "John"
[]            System.out.println(myObj.getName());
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> John



============================================================================================================================================ ~!POLYMORPHISM /OOP
// OOP
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
Previously, we mentioned that inheritance lets us inherit attributes and methods from another class. Polymorphism uses
those methods to perform different tasks. This allows us to perform a single action in different ways.

For example, think of a superclass called Animal that has a method called animalSound(). Subclasses of Animals could be
Pigs, Cats, Dogs, Birds - And they also have their own implementation of an animal sound (the pig oinks, and the cat
meows, etc.):

[]    class Animal {
[]        public void animalSound() {
[]            System.out.println("The animal makes a sound");
[]        }
[]    }
[]
[]    class Pig extends Animal {
[]        public void animalSound() {
[]            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
[]        }
[]    }
[]
[]    class Dog extends Animal {
[]        public void animalSound() {
[]            System.out.println("The dog says: bow wow");
[]        }
[]    }
[]
[]    class Main {
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
[]            Animal myPig = new Pig();
[]            Animal myDog = new Dog();
[]            myAnimal.animalSound();
[]            myPig.animalSound();
[]            myDog.animalSound();
[]        }
[]    }



============================================================================================================================================ ~!ABSTRACTION /OOP
// OOP
Data abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
Why? To achieve security - hide certain details and only show the important details of an object.
     (users only see the abstract class, not the inherited subclass, thus info is hidden)

NOTE: Not all members of an abstract class has to be abstract. Another by default 'abstract' class type is interface. See tag_interface

 - Abstract class: is a restricted class that cannot be used to create objects (to access it, it must be inherited
                   from another class).
 - Abstract method: can only be used in an abstract class, and it does not have a body. The body is provided by the
                   subclass (inherited from).

[]    abstract class Animal {
[]        public abstract void animalSound();
[]        public void sleep() {
[]            System.out.println("Zzz");
[]        }
[]    }
[]    ...
[]    Animal myObj = new Animal();  // will generate an error


[]    // Abstract class
[]    abstract class Animal {
[]        // Abstract method (does not have a body)
[]        public abstract void animalSound();
[]        // Regular method
[]        public void sleep() {             <-- Not all members of abstract class has no be abstract
[]            System.out.println("Zzz");
[]        }
[]    }
[] ---------------------------------------------------------
[]    // Subclass (inherit from Animal)
[]    class Pig extends Animal {
[]        public void animalSound() {
[]            // The body of animalSound() is provided here
[]            System.out.println("The pig says: wee wee");
[]        }
[]    }
[] ---------------------------------------------------------
[]    class Main {
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            Pig myPig = new Pig(); // Create a Pig object
[]            myPig.animalSound();
[]            myPig.sleep();
[]        }
[]    }
[]    >>> The pig says: wee wee
[]    >>> Zzz



============================================================================================================================================ ~!INTERFACES /OOP
// OOP ~!multipleinheritance

An interface is a completely "abstract class" that is used to GROUP RELATED METHODS WITH EMPTY BODIES, no {}.
Like abstract classes, interfaces cannot be used to create objects. There are a number of situations in software
engineering when it is important for disparate groups of programmers to agree to a "contract" that spells out how
their software interacts. Each group should be able to write their code without any knowledge of how the other
group's code is written. Generally speaking, interfaces are such contracts.

Interfaces can have multiple implementations (multiple inheritance). Interface methods do not have a body - the
body is provided by the "implement" class. On implementation of an interface, you must override all of its methods
(provide body) (required args must be pre-defined in interface methods)

NOTE: Use 'implements' to define interface body. Use 'extends' to extend interface bodies. Codes that implement/rely
      on the old interface won't be affected.
NOTE: methods are by default 'PUBLIC', 'ABSTRACT' ONLY
NOTE: attributes are by default 'PUBLIC', 'STATIC', 'FINAL' ONLY
NOTE: An interface cannot contain a constructor (as it cannot be used to create objects)
NOTE: Inner interface of nested interfaces/classes are by default 'PUBLIC', 'STATIC'. but they can also use any modifiers.
      More at: https://cs-fundamentals.com/java-programming/java-static-nested-or-inner-interfaces
      Inner interfaces in the following top level bodies can be accessed via:
          1. In classes   : 'class ... implements Outerclass.InterfaceName'
          2. In interface : 'class ... implements InterfaceName' (direct)


  *In the real source code, if all below code are in the same file, class Main should be placed first (at the top)
   before interfaces & class Democlass, else 'ERROR: can't find main(String[]) method in class: FirstInterface'

MULTIPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS
[]
[]    interface FirstInterface {
[]        int x = 0;                       // interface attribute declared                    PUBLIC STATIC FINAL
[]        public void myMethod();          // interface method (does not have a body, no {})  PUBLIC ABSTRACT
[]    }
[]
[]    interface SecondInterface {
[]        public int myOtherMethod(int n); // interface method can have return type & required args
[]    }
[]
[]    class DemoClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface {    <-- MULTIPLE IMPLEMENTATIONS
[]    // NOTE: can also be 'class DemoClass extends OtherClass implements FirstInterface, SecondInterface'
[]    //       inheritance & implementation going on at the same time.
[]        public void myMethod() {
[]            System.out.println("Some text..");
[]        }
[]        public int myOtherMethod(int n) {
[]            return n;

[]            DemoClass myObj = new DemoClass();
[]            myObj.myMethod();
[]            System.out.println(myObj.myOtherMethod(5));

============================================================================================================================================ ~!ENUMERATES /OOP
// OOP

Reference: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/javaOO/enum.html
Enum is short for "enumerations", which means "specifically listed". An enum is a special "class" that represents
a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables). An enum can, just like a class, have attributes
and methods. The only difference is that enum constants are PUBLIC, STATIC and FINAL (unchangeable - cannot be overridden).
Why And When To Use Enums? Use enums when you have values that you know aren't going to change, like month days, colors, etc.

NOTE: An enum class cannot be used to create objects, and it cannot extend other classes (but it can implement interfaces).
NOTE: Enum constants must be in FULL CAPITAL LETTERS.
NOTE: *TREAT CONSTANTS AS ATTRIBUTES OF A CLASS. i.e.:
       from outside class: 'Planet.EARTH.method()'
       from same enum class: 'EARTH.method()'
       Detailed example: 'OptimizedForPlanet.java'

NOTE: Enum constants can also have personal attributes, but you have to pass them to the constructor to be assigned to the 'obj'.
      Constructor is required. The constructor for an enum type must be package-private (default) or private access. It automatically
      creates the constants 'obj' that are defined at the beginning of the enum body (template). You cannot invoke an enum
      constructor yourself. It'll be invoked automatically when you call the enum's attribute (i.e. EARTH.mass)
      []
      []    public enum Planets {
      []        EARTH   (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6),                   <-- constants' template must be defined before anything.
      []        MARS    (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6);
      []        private final double mass;       // in kilograms  <-- enum obj's attributes (values assigned when constructor called)
      []        private final double radius;     // in meters
      []        Planet(double mass, double radius) {              <-- enum constructor (args arranged according to template)
      []            this.mass = mass;
      []            this.radius = radius;
      []        }
      []    }

Some very basic enum code
[]    public enum Day {
[]        SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY,
[]        THURSDAY, FRIDAY, SATURDAY                             <-- No ';' for only enum constants
[]    }
[] ----------------------------------------------------Class to utilise enum Day
[]    public class EnumTest {
[]        Day day;                                               <-- Day object as class attribute
[]        public EnumTest(Day obj) {
[]            this.day = obj;
[]        }
[]        public void tellItLikeItIs() {
[]            switch (day) {
[]                case MONDAY:
[]                    System.out.println("Mondays are bad.");
[]                    break;
[]                default:
[]                    System.out.println("Midweek days are so-so.");
[]                    break;
[]            }
[]        }
[]        public static void main(String[] args) {
[]            EnumTest firstDay = new EnumTest(Day.MONDAY);      <--NOTE: call by 'enumClass.constantName' from an outside class
[]            firstDay.tellItLikeItIs();
[]        }
[]    }
[] ----------------------------------------------------Output
[]    >>> Mondays are bad.


Each enum constant is declared with values for the mass and radius parameters. These values are passed to the
constructor when the constant is created. Java requires that the constants be defined first, prior to any fields
or methods. Also, when there are fields and methods, the list of enum constants must end with a semicolon ';'.
NOTE: The constructor for an enum type must be package-private or private access. It automatically creates the
constants that are defined at the beginning of the enum body. You cannot invoke an enum constructor yourself.

In addition to its properties and constructor, Planet has methods that allow you to retrieve the surface gravity
and weight of an object on each planet. Here is a sample program that takes your weight on earth (in any unit)
and calculates and prints your weight on all of the planets (in the same unit):


[]    public enum Planet {
[]        MERCURY (3.303e+23, 2.4397e6),                     <-- constants' template must be defined before anything.
[]        VENUS   (4.869e+24, 6.0518e6),                         (planetMass, planetRadius)
[]        EARTH   (5.976e+24, 6.37814e6),
[]        MARS    (6.421e+23, 3.3972e6),
[]        JUPITER (1.9e+27,   7.1492e7),

============================================================================================================================================ ~!ITERATORS /OOP
// OOP ~!iterables

Classes that implement the 'Iterable' interface & can be converted to 'Iterators' (see link below: Iterable)
Interface Iterable: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html
Interface Iterator: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html


Iterators are designed to easily change the collections that they loop through. The remove() method can remove items
from a collection while looping.
NOTE: Trying to remove items using a for loop or a for-each loop would not work correctly because the collection is
changing size at the same time that the code is trying to loop. (for/for-each loop requires pre-defined loop size)
>>> Use while loop.
NOTE: An iterator object can only be iterated through once.
NOTE: User-defined class objects that needs to be converted to Iterators must implements both the 'Iterable' & 'Iterator'
